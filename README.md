This is a Newsapp where you can check the news of a specific domain as of your wish and then read the latest news.I used news api to fetch the data(news) and made changes according to my app.
This react app is mostly madeup using bootstrap and some of my own css with many javascript functions in it.
Currently couldn't host this react app as news api doesn't allow to publicly deploy my project if you are interested enough, you can clone the repository and run in your local host.
